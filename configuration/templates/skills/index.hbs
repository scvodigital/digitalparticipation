      <h1>Skills</h1>
      <p>
        The internet is part of everyday life for most people. We use it to communicate, to shop, to work and to solve problems. We can use digital technology to do things that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago, and this pace of change will only get faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/essential-digital-skills-framework">Essential Digital Skills Framework</a> gives us a clear description of the skills we all need to make the most of these new opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        SCVO have developed the Essential Digital Skills toolkit to help you make practical use of the framework. It contains simple checklists for measuring Foundation Skills and Essential Skills, and guidance on how to interpret the results.
